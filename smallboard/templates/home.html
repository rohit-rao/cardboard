                    <b>What is this?</b><br>
                    A dashboard for managing puzzles and tracking status during a puzzle hunt, such as MIT Mystery Hunt:
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Why do I have to sign in?</b><br>
                    We use Google login to ensure that users only see puzzles for the hunts they are participating in.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>How are you using my data?</b><br>
                    We match your email against an allowlist of emails for each hunt. The actions you take while using the smallboard (such as solving a puzzle) may be logged and attributed to your email. This data is only used for logging purposes. See <a href="{% url 'privacy'%}">here</a> for our full privacy policy.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Cool. Why does it say "Your credentials aren't allowed" when I try to sign in?</b> <br>
                    You are currently not allowlisted for any active hunts. If you believe you should have access or would like to be allowlisted for a hunt, please ask someone. If you don't know who to ask, this probably isn't the site for you.
